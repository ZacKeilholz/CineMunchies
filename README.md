<https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis>
+ Must use new library of tech we haven't used yet 
+ Must have a slick UI
+ Must have clean code that meets coding standards
+ Shouldn't use alerts, prompts, or confirms
+ Must have some sort of repeating element like tables, columns, or calendars
+ Must use Bootstrap or an alternative CSS framework 
+ Must be deployed on github pages
+ Must have user input validation
+ Must use Firebase to store information

# Nice to Have Features
 + Mobile responsiveness
 + Utilize Materialize or other CSS Frameworks


# Project Questions

Have the project on one github account and add everyone else as a collaborator.

# Presentation
There will be a formal presentation.      
The presentation should be about 10 minutes long and showcase the functionality of the project as well as a slick UI/UX.

# Metrics for the Project
+ Concept
+ Design
+ Functionality
+ Collaboration
+ Presentation

# API Suggestions
Stick to APIs with these features: 
+ Allows CORS -   
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS>
+ Simple/no authentication
+ JSON response returned
+ Well documented

# Tools
+ Trello for project management

# Group Name Ideas:
 ## Team Urkel


# Group To-Dos
1.  ~~Come up with a group name.~~   
2. Create a slack channel instead of just DMing. 
3. ~~Come up with useful project ideas~~
4. ~~Find and decide on several APIs that can be used~~
5. ~~Discuss roles based on group project recommendations?~~
